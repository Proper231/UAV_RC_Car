ARDUINO

The Arduino file contains 3 files within. The LEFT_RIGHT file just shows that the car is able to turn left right, which we were unable to successfully implement. 
The Brain_test file is our attempt at left turn and righ turns when the model is running. The Brain_final is the file used in our implementation.
