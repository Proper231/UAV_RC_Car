PTYHON

The python file contains the UAV.py file which is used to run the model and send signals to the arduino used in out video. The Best.pt is the trained YOLO model which has 4 classes.

ARDUINO

The Arduino file contains 3 files within. The LEFT_RIGHT file just shows that the car is able to turn left right, which we were unable to successfully implement. 
The Brain_test file is our attempt at left turn and righ turns when the model is running. The Brain_final is the file used in our implementation.

These 3 videos show a demonstration of the RC car in action.
